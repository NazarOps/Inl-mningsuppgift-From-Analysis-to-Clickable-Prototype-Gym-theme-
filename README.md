### Preconditions:

* User is located on the main page (index.html)
* User has an account
* Login form should include an email and password
* User has selected their role

Main Flow:

- User visits the website, lands on index.html and proceeds to login
- The website should display the login form with a role slider
- User chooses role
- User inputs their e-mail and password
- User clicks "Sign up" button
- The system should validate user details
- The system should verify the user
- System creates a login session
- System redirects user to the corresponding dashboard based on their role

Alternate Flows: 

- In case of incorrect e-mail and password credentials, the system should notify the user to input correct information
- The system should notify the user if they are trying to login with a different role that they do not have permissions for

--------

### Postconditions:

- After inputting the correct credentials, the user should be redirected to the corresponding page
- In case of incorrect credentials, the user will remain on the login page until they enter correct details

--------

### Risks and limitations
- Login is client-side only and does not provide real authentication or security.
- User roles are simulated and not validated against a backend.
- No persistent session handling or data storage is implemented.

--------

### Possible improvements
- Add backend authentication and database integration.
- Improve accessibility testing with screen readers.
- Add role-based dashboards with dynamic content.
