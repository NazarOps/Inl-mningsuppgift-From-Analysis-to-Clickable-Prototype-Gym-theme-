## Prompt 1
**Prompt:**
"How can I style a role selector using radio buttons so it looks like a slider?"

**What AI gave:**
AI provided an example of how radio buttons can be styled with CSS to visually behave like a slider, including use of pseudo-classes and positioning.

**What I changed manually:**
I adapted the styling to fit my own design, layout and color scheme, and integrated it into my existing HTML structure instead of using the exact example.

## Prompt 2
**Prompt:**
"How can I validate a login form with JavaScript and redirect to another page?"

**What AI gave:**
AI suggested using `addEventListener`, `preventDefault()` and simple input validation before redirecting with `window.location`.

**What I changed manually:**
I rewrote most of the logic to match my own HTML IDs and structure, simplified the validation logic, and connected it to my existing login flow.

## Prompt 3
**Prompt:**
"Is my HTML structure semantically correct for a gym website with index, login and dashboard pages?"

**What AI gave:**
AI explained semantic HTML concepts and gave feedback on use of elements such as `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, and forms.

**What I changed manually:**
I reviewed my code and made my own decisions about structure. I mainly used the feedback as a checklist to ensure my pages met the assignment requirements.

## Reflection
Using AI helped me understand best practices faster, especially for CSS styling and form handling, but I still had to understand and adapt everything myself.  
I learned that AI works best as support and guidance, not as a replacement for my own problem-solving and coding.
